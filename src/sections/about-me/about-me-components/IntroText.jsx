            <p className={`medium-font`}>Hey<span className={`${styles.wave} cursor`} >ðŸ‘‹</span>, I'm Shreetej Hadge. I'm currently a Computer Science Student at Arizona State University
                in my Sophomore Year. I am highly passionate about building cool software, and learning more about the vast, endless field of Computer Science and Software Engineering. For now, I am deep into
                the world of web dev, while polishing my Java, Python, and C/C++ skills.
                I am also highly interested in Data Science, Data Visualization, Artificial Intelligence, and Embedded Systems.... I'm no expert here, but I'm curious and wish to learn more about them.

                When I'm not on my computer, I spend my time swimming, watching basketball,
                catching up to the latest shows and movies and reading some manga. My goal is to simply build cool stuff and do cool things<span className={`${styles.cool} cursor`} >ðŸ˜Ž</span>
